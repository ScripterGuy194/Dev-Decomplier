# Dev Decompiler (Executor Version)

**Dev Decompiler** is a Roblox script utility designed for developers using script executors.  
It lets you browse, filter, and attempt to view the source of scripts (`Script` and `LocalScript`) inside various Roblox services, and copy them to your clipboard ‚Äî all from a sleek, in-game draggable UI.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is built for **executor environments** and is **not meant to run from StarterGui or Roblox Studio**.

## üîí Limitations

- Roblox protects `Script.Source` and most server-side scripts.
- Only client-visible or `LocalScript` sources are reliably accessible.
- The script uses `getclipboard()` or `setclipboard()` ‚Äî must be supported by your executor.
- This tool **does not and will not bypass Roblox‚Äôs protected memory**. If a script is locked, it will be labeled as such.
